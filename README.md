README â€“ Landmine Detection Robot
Project Overview
This project involves a semi-autonomous robot capable of detecting metallic landmines, capturing GPS coordinates of detection events, and streaming live video for remote inspection. It uses WiFi for real-time control and communication, and is operated wirelessly using a smartphone app (Blynk).
How to Work with This Prototype
Hardware Components Required - 
â€¢	Arduino Uno (for motor and sensor control)
â€¢	ESP32 (for Blynk communication and live data transfer)
â€¢	ESP32-CAM (for live video streaming)
â€¢	L298N Motor Driver
â€¢	4 Ã— DC Motors
â€¢	Robocraze Metal Detector Module
â€¢	KY-038 Sound Sensor
â€¢	NEO-6M GPS Module
â€¢	Power supply (Li-ion battery or 9V battery pack)
â€¢	Robot chassis + wheels
Control Interface â€“ Smartphone (Blynk App)
â€¢	App Required: Blynk IoT (iOS/Android)
â€¢	Authentication: Enter your Blynk Auth Token from the Arduino code
â€¢	Virtual Pins Used:
o	V4 â€“ Joystick X (Left/Right)
o	V5 â€“ Joystick Y (Forward/Backward)
o	V6 â€“ Slider to control motor speed (0â€“255)
o	V7/V8 â€“ GPS coordinates displayed on screen when metal is detected
Setup Instructions
1.	Upload the Arduino Code
o	Open the provided .ino file in Arduino IDE.
o	Select the correct board (ESP32 Dev Module).
o	Connect the ESP32 via USB and upload the code.
o	Replace the WiFi credentials and Blynk token with your own.
2.	Hardware Connections
o	Wire the DC motors to the L298N Motor Driver, then connect control pins to Arduino (pins 14, 27, 26, 25, 32, 33, 18, 19).
o	Connect the metal detector module and KY-038 sound sensor to analog pin A0 or GPIO 34 on ESP32.
o	Attach GPS module (TX â†’ GPIO16, RX â†’ GPIO17).
o	Connect ESP32-CAM with separate power (recommended 5V with 2A).
o	Mount everything securely to the robot chassis.
3.	Power On
o	Power both Arduino Uno and ESP32 modules using a rechargeable battery pack.
o	Wait for ESP32 to connect to WiFi (check serial monitor output for confirmation).
Operating the Robot
â€¢	Launch Blynk App on your phone.
â€¢	Use the joystick to navigate the robot:
o	Forward, backward, left, and right control via V4 and V5.
â€¢	Adjust speed using the slider (V6).
â€¢	Live GPS location of metal detection appears in real-time (V7, V8).
â€¢	ESP32-CAM provides live video feed (access via your local IP address â€“ shown in serial monitor).
Metal Detection Behavior
â€¢	The metal detector module senses metallic objects.
â€¢	The KY-038 sound sensor detects beeps from the detector.
â€¢	Upon confirmation, GPS coordinates are automatically captured and sent to the phone.
Live Video Streaming
â€¢	Once ESP32-CAM is powered, it connects to your WiFi.
â€¢	Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to get the IP address.
â€¢	Paste the IP into your browser to view the live video stream.
